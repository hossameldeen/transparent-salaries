# Transparent Salaries

A social network for sharing salaries, anonymously.

![Screenshot of a (perhaps-dummy) Transparent-Salaries profile](./screenshot.png)

A [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) website where each user:

- **Posts <u>anonymized</u> salaries known to them**, e.g., of people from their network, after taking their permission.
- **Specifies other users they trust** to be honest and write true salaries.

## Contributing

Part of me is not comfortable taking someone's labour for free. Another part is eager to cooperate.

In a perfect world, I'd set up a way for paying money to contributors; I even have a scheme in mind. However, since paying money is cumbersome on the Internet and since Transparent Salaries's future is still uncertain, for now there's no such method.

So, long story short: **Contributions are welcome!** And sorry for possibly exploiting you :(

### Work organization

A big-picture on work status can be found in [Project: Board](https://github.com/hossameldeen/transparent-salaries/projects/2). The [other projects](https://github.com/hossameldeen/transparent-salaries/projects) are grouping of related issues.

Contributions are welcome on all issues. `Contribution-welcome-*` labels are for extra encouragement and for issues ready to be worked on.

### Documentation

There isn't much documentation. I'm using [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/) with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) and [Angular Flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/Declarative-API-Overview). Any documentation can be founder under [docs/](./docs/)
