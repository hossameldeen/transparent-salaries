1- Buying a copy
================

You can buy a copy through https://gumroad.com/l/gDDIe

Your rights are whatever the default right are when someone buys a copy of an
all-rights-reserved work.

A copy contains both the compiled website and the source code.

2- Evaluation
=============

You can read the source code or use the compiled website for free for
evaluation purposes only.

3- Free Copies
==============

Anyone matching this criteria can use Transparent Salaries for free as long as
the criteria applies to them. Once the criteria stops applying to them, they
need to buy a copy for continued usage.

The criteria:

 - Anyone whose last year's income is less than 26000 USD.
 - Any student using Transparent Salaries for educational purposes only.
 - Anyone less than 18 years old.
 - Anyone unable to buy a copy for Transparent Salaries. For example, due to
   payment methods being unavailable in their country.

If you think you deserve a free copy but none of this criteria applies to you,
open an issue describing your case.

4- Derivation
=============

Assuming you don't have the right to make derivations of Transparent Salaries,
I give you this right as long as you adhere to this conditions:

 - For every copy of your derived work, regardless of it was sold for money or
   given for free, a copy of Transparent Salaries must be bought.
 - Of course, making it clear in your work that I don't necessarily endorse
   your work.
 - Don't name it "Transparent Salaries" and don't infringe on my trademarks and
   other rights in general.

If you want to derive your work from just a subset of Transparent Salaries and
don't want your users to buy a full copy of Transparent Salaries, open an issue
and I might extract the part you want into a smaller and cheaper artifact.
