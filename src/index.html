  <!-- It looks bad in some cases like making `font-size: bold;` instead of using `mat-body-strong`. However, sometimes
       I have to use `bold`, e.g., in a header. So, for now, I'm not gonna use it.

       However, **important**: not using it means you can't use mat-typography classes. To use it, you'll need to
       provide a font and/or give it to font-family in some scss files. Check material typography guide.
       But you can use the `mat-typography` class on the app root and it does make a good difference.

       Update: Reverted to using it. Found a way to not need bolds. Overall, I'm happier with this font, but I don't
               like it on the main page, especially in "Join Transparent Salaries now.".
